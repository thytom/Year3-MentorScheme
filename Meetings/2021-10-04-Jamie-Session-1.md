# Meeting with Jamie about Session 1: Linux and Git

* New students are being encouraged to install a linux virtual machine with
  Virtualbox
* They have been shown how to install ubuntu; some might have other distros
* Jamie wants us to focus a lot more on using the VirtualBox VM. Some points that
  should be covered:
	* Installing software
  		* Can demonstrate this by installing the `build-essentials` package
	* How to get full screen working
		* Also increasing vram
		* Will involve installing the virtualbox guest additions
	* **Copying and pasting between VM and host machine**
* Link to the guide used by the students is [here]:

## The Activity Session

* As of Monday 4th:
	* Out of 390 students, **162** have not even forked the WTTM work
* A lot of students are not going to have done even that, so Jamie thinks
  it's best if we give them the time to do that session.
* For those who have completed that session, I want to do a git-based
  worksheet involving making your own repository on the school gitlab.
